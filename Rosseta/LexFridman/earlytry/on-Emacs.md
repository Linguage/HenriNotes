[Lex Fridman on Emacs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RC5yGM8fk8g&t=219s)

## 中文

Q: Emacs有趣的地方在于它已经存在很长时间了，是的，我认为你已经谈到了，有一些时尚，当然在软件工程领域，思考那些持续很长时间的技术，以及它们是如何生存下来的，就像是软件界的蟑螂或者是细菌之类的东西，这种基本的东西，每个人都依赖，它们持续存在，慢慢地随着时间的推移进行调整，略有延迟，略有个人定制，但它们总是潜伏在阴影中，是的，它们比其他所有东西都持久，我想这可能是很多技术的故事，尤其是在软件领域。

A: Shell脚本，你知道，所有这些东西，你不能没有一堆shell脚本运行现代世界，你知道，启动机器，运行各种东西，所以，是的，那将是一个难以替代的东西。

Q: 然后排版方面的技术，你说你用的是，当我想要打印时。

A: 是的，我只是有一些简单的宏，但是然后我不得不，出版商坚持他们要用Word格式，所以，多年前我写了一些宏来转换，这次我怎么做了，复制粘贴吗？不，我使用了一些正则表达式，所以我可以在Tech中创建一个正则表达式，它会寻找在大括号之间的一些文本，前面是反斜杠it，然后转换成斜体，而Word会在它的搜索和替换UI中这样做。

Q: 是的，你这样做很有趣，我想肯定有工具可以帮助你做这种事情，但是任务足够简单，你可以比其他任何人做得更好，是的，是的，所以这是一个迷人的过程。

A: 对我来说效果很好，而且它可以防止你对格式进行混乱，比如，如果我把这个章节标题放在无衬线字体中，你知道，这只是经典的炫耀，而在我所做的事情中，这些选项被关闭了。

Q: once you do type stuff up you you use
emacs yeah I use emacs obviously the
superior editor of course
you uh let me just ask the ridiculous
futuristic question because emacs has
been around forever do you think in 100
years
we will still have emacs and Vim
or like pick it pick a let's say 50 100


A: no I mean whenever you're
doing anything in Linux
you you're spending a lot of time
editing little config files and
scripts and stuff and uh you need to be
able to pop in and out of
of editing those things and it needs to
work
like even if the the windowing GUI is
dead and all you've got is like a
command line you to get out of that
problem you might need to to enter an
editor and uh and alter a file so I
think on that level
there will always have to be sort of uh
very simple well emacs isn't very simple
but you know what I mean there have to
be basic editors that you can use from
either the command line or a GUI
um just for administering systems
now how widespread they'll be
um
you know there's a certain amount of
what's the story of the
the there's the the American folk tale
of the the the guy who the hammer guy
who drives the railroad spikes John
Henry trying to keep up with the steam
hammer and eventually this the steam
Hammer wins because he can't drive the
spikes fast enough so there's there's a
sense in which
you know Microsoft like
who knows how much they've invested in
code you know Visual Studio to you know
or or apple with xcode so they've put
huge amounts of money into enhancing
their Ides
and emacs in theory can duplicate all of
those features
um by you know if you just have enough
Linux hackers writing emacs lisp macros
but you know it at some point
um it's going to be hard to to maintain
that
level of uh of to to keep up feature for
feature


Q: the the interesting thing about emacs
just is lasted a long time yeah and I I
think you've talked about
there's a certain like there's certain
fads
uh certainly in a in the um
software engineering space
and it's interesting to think about
technologies that sort of last
for a very long time and just kind of
being in the
what is it how do they get by it's like
the the
uh the Cockroaches of software or 
the bacteria are software or something
the like this base thing that nobody
everybody's just became reliant on
uh and they just Outlast everything else
and slowly slowly adjust with the times
with a little bit of a delay with a
little bit of customization by
individuals kind of that
but they're always there in the shadows
yeah and they Outlast everybody else
and I wonder if that's that might be the
story for a lot of Technologies
especially in the software space yeah


A: shell scripts you know all that stuff
you you CA you can't run the modern
world without
a bunch of shell scripts you know
booting up machines and and and running
things so um
it's yeah
that is going to be a hard thing to to
replace 

Q: and then tech for type setting
that you use you said
for when I want to print it out 

A: yeah I
just have some simple uh macros that I
use but then I have to um
the the publisher put their foot down
and they they want it in in word format
now so
um years ago I wrote some macros to
convert
and this time
what did I do copy paste No I um I use
sort of regular Expressions so I was to
do italics in uh you know you you put it
in curly brackets and you do backslash i
t and then you type what you want to
type and that's how you get italics and
Tech
so you can create a regular expression
that'll look for some text between curly
brackets preceded by backslash it and
then uh instead
convert that to italics and word will do
that
word if you go deep enough into its
search and replace
UI 

Q:  yeah
it's funny that you did that yeah I mean
I'm sure there's tools that help you
with that kind of thing but but the task
is sufficiently
simple
to where you can do a much better job
than anyone anybody else that still can
yeah yeah so that's a fascinating
process 

A: it works fine for me yeah and it
keeps you from messing around with
formatting yeah like oh what if I put
this chapter heading you know in
you know a sans-serif font you know it's
a it's just classic wanking
um and so you the the
those options are closed off in what I'm
doing

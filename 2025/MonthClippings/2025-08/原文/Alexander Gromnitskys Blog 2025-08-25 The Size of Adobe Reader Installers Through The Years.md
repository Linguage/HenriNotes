## The Size of Adobe Reader Installers Through The Years

Latest update:

At the time of writing, the most recent Adobe Reader 25.x.y.z 64-bit installer for Windows 11 weights **687,230,424 bytes**. After installation, the program includes 'AI' (of course), an auto-updater, sprinkled ads for *Acrobat online services* everywhere, and 2 GUIs: 'new' and 'old'.

For comparison, the size of SumatraPDF-3.5.2 installer is 8,246,744 bytes. It has no 'AI', no auto-updater (though it can check for new versions, which I find unnecessary, for anyone sane would install it via scoop anyway), and no ads for 'cloud storage'.

The following chart shows how the Adobe Reader installer has grown in size over the years. When possible, 64-bit versions of installers were used.

**Next Day Update:**

Best comment on Hacker News: *"Looks like a chart crime scene."*

Alright, here's your linear graph, along with [the source](https://sigwait.org/~alex/blog/2025/08/25/installers.tar) from which both graphs were generated. All point labels are version numbers.
